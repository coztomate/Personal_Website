I am a senior researcher in the field of clinical psychology. I am trained in R and SPSS for data handling, visualization, and modelling and currently diving deeper into Python/SQL/Git for data analysis, handling, and version control. Due to my background as a psychologist and psychotherapist I have strong communication skills and understanding of human behavior behind the data. Data becomes powerful when analyzed thoughtfully using the right techniques and communicated in comprehensive way. My experience in teaching, publication and presentation of data has taught me to effectively explain insights to a technical and non-technical audience. Due to my experience in supervision, project management, and psychotherapy I know to support people and groups in their personal and professional development. Being always eager about my own learning and development, my passion about data now leads me to focus on more data centered roles.
