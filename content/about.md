As a data scientist with a background in psychology and quantitative analysis, I bring a unique perspective to the field. My expertise includes processing, analyzing, and interpreting both structured and unstructured data using statistical and machine learning techniques to produce reliable predictions. I am skilled in deploying models into production environments, a critical step in turning theoretical models into practical tools. My experience in research, mentoring, and disseminating results has equipped me with the ability to effectively communicate complex data insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

My background in psychology and psychotherapy has also endowed me with strong communication skills and an understanding of the human behavior that often underlies data patterns. This combination of technical expertise and interpersonal abilities enables me to deliver comprehensive data science solutions that are grounded in both technical rigor and a profound understanding of human factors.
