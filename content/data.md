#### Predicting Earthquake Building Damage

Here, I joined my first data science competition and scored within the highest 5% of all contestants online, using XGBoost and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.

The dataset provided for the competition was a comprehensive collection derived from surveys conducted by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics.
