#### Predicting Earthquake Building Damage

Here I joined my first data science competition and scored within the highest 5% of all contestants online. The competition's primary objective was to use data related to building location and construction to forecast the extent of damage inflicted by the earthquake. The dataset provided for the competition was a comprehensive collection derived from surveys conducted by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics.
