I have a keen interest in various domains within the field of psychology, with a particular emphasis on the clinical psychology of both adults and children. My doctoral research focused on the intergenerational effects of trauma and mental disorders. My experience extends to working as a psychotherapist, specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals and groups. I am deeply committed to evidence-based practices that align with the latest research developments. This unique blend of research and therapeutic work has allowed me to view challenges and research areas from multiple perspectives. In my role as a mentor, I have consistently emphasized the importance of robust methodological foundations to guide the research paths of my mentees.
