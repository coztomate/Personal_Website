# Katja Dittrich's Personal Website

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for [my personal website](http://www.dittrichkatja.com), a static site built with Hugo. The website showcases my professional portfolio, personal projects, and other information. It's based on the [Hugo Initio template](https://www.gettemplate.com/), which has been customized to fit my personal style and content needs. 

## Features
- **Personal Portfolio**: Displays professional work, projects, and achievements.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility and visual appeal across various devices.
- **Customized HTML/CSS**: Tailored to reflect a unique personal style.

## Technologies Used
- [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/): An open-source static site generator.
- [**Initio Template**](https://www.gettemplate.com/): A responsive Hugo template.

## Initial Setup
To create a website similar to this, you'll need to start with the Hugo Initio template. Ensure you have Hugo installed on your machine, and then follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Original Initio Repository**: 

    ```git clone https://github.com/miguelsimoni/hugo-initio.git```


2. **Navigate to the Repository**:

    ```cd hugo-initio```


3. **Run Hugo Server**:

    ```hugo server```


This starts the Hugo server, allowing you to view and edit the template locally at `localhost:1313`.

## Customization
After cloning the Initio template, you can modify the HTML and CSS files to personalize your website. Refer to my repository as an example of how you can customize the template.
